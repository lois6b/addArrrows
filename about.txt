This is a Tampermonkey script.

This adds arrows to Stack Exchange chatroom mobile version.

Why?

In case you use the mobile version on the pc, is a bit annoying to click on the message and go up to select the reply option. 

So I add arrows to response on hover.

Also if you already had something wrote, it adds the reply ID without removing your input text.
